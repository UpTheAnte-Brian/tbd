This is a great moment to pause and do this review — your UI is already structurally sound. What you need now is governance correctness, not more features.

I’ll do this in two parts:
	1.	Review your current minutes UI against Robert’s Rules / nonprofit best practices
	2.	Propose a structured minutes template that fits your schema + UI perfectly

No fluff, no academic theory — this is practical board governance.

1️⃣ Review of Your Minutes UI (Against Best Practices)

✅ What You’re Doing Right (Very Right)

1. Draft vs Approval Is Explicit
You have:
	•	A minutes editor
	•	A Save Minutes action
	•	A separate approval action
	•	A signer selector
	•	A post-save approval requirement

This matches real governance exactly.

❗ Many systems get this wrong by auto-approving on save. You did not.

⸻

2. Approval Is an Affirmative Act
Your UI requires:
	•	Selecting a signer
	•	Clicking “Record Minutes Approval”

This is critical because minutes approval is a board action, not a document edit.

✔️ Correct under Robert’s Rules
✔️ Legally defensible

⸻

3. Immutability Is Enforced Conceptually
Even before RLS/triggers:
	•	Your UI clearly implies “this locks the record”
	•	Approval is a terminal state

This aligns with:
	•	IRS expectations
	•	State nonprofit statutes
	•	Audit norms

⸻

⚠️ Where You Should Tighten Things

These are not criticisms — they’re refinements.

⸻

A) The Minutes Text Area Is Too Open-Ended (For Long-Term Use)

Right now, users can type anything:

test
then we did something

That’s fine technically — but governance best practice is to guide behavior.

Robert’s Rules strongly recommend structured minutes, not freeform narrative.

Risk if left as-is
	•	Overly verbose minutes
	•	Inclusion of debate or opinions
	•	Increased legal exposure

⸻

B) Approval Language Needs a Warning

Before approval, boards are typically warned:

“Once approved, these minutes become the official and permanent record of the organization.”

You should surface this explicitly (modal or inline warning).

⸻

C) Attendance / Quorum Is Missing (Conceptually)

Robert’s Rules expect minutes to reflect:
	•	Who was present
	•	Whether quorum was met

You don’t need full attendance tracking yet, but your minutes template should acknowledge quorum.

⸻

2️⃣ Proposed Structured Minutes Template (Recommended)

This template is:
	•	Robert’s Rules–aligned
	•	Minimal (not bureaucratic)
	•	Fits your single content column
	•	Future-proof (you can parse it later if you want)

🧾 Canonical Board Minutes Template

## Meeting Information
- **Date:** {{meeting_date}}
- **Time:** {{start_time}} – {{end_time}}
- **Type:** {{regular | special}}
- **Location / Medium:** {{in person | virtual | hybrid}}

## Attendance
The following board members were present:
- {{Name}}
- {{Name}}

The following board members were absent:
- {{Name}}

A quorum was ☐ present ☐ not present.

## Call to Order
The meeting was called to order by {{Chair Name}} at {{time}}.

## Approval of Previous Minutes
The minutes of the previous meeting were ☐ approved ☐ approved as amended.

## Motions and Actions
1. **Motion:** {{Motion title or description}}  
   - Moved by: {{Name}}  
   - Seconded by: {{Name}}  
   - Vote: {{Approved | Rejected | Tabled}}  
   - Result: {{# Yes}} Yes, {{# No}} No, {{# Abstain}} Abstain  

## Reports (if any)
- {{Treasurer’s report accepted}}
- {{Committee updates}}

## New Business
- {{Brief summary of actions taken}}

## Adjournment
The meeting was adjourned at {{time}}.

3️⃣ How This Maps Cleanly to Your System

Draft Phase
	•	User pastes or edits this template
	•	Content is editable
	•	No approvals exist yet

Approval Phase
	•	Chair/Admin selects signer
	•	Approval is recorded
	•	approved_at is set
	•	Trigger enforces immutability

Legal Interpretation

Once approved, this record:
	•	Proves quorum
	•	Proves authority
	•	Documents votes
	•	Shows procedural compliance

⸻

4️⃣ UI Improvements I’d Recommend (Small but High Impact)

A) “Insert Template” Button

Add a button above the textarea:

Insert Standard Minutes Template

This:
	•	Teaches users good governance
	•	Reduces bad data
	•	Doesn’t constrain advanced users

⸻

B) Approval Warning (Modal)

Before recording approval:

⚠️ Approval is Final
Once approved, these minutes become the official and permanent record of the organization and cannot be edited.

Required checkbox:

☐ I understand and approve these minutes as final.

⸻

C) Read-Only View After Approval

Once approved:
	•	Render markdown
	•	Remove textarea
	•	Show approval metadata

This reinforces immutability visually.

⸻

5️⃣ One Important Governance Principle to Keep

Minutes record what was done, not what was said.

Your system already supports this — the template simply nudges users in the right direction.

⸻

Summary (Straight Talk)
	•	✅ Your minutes workflow is correct
	•	✅ Your approval model is legally sound
	•	⚠️ Add structure to guide users
	•	⚠️ Add explicit approval warnings
	•	🚀 You’re building this better than many commercial board portals

If you want next, I can:
	•	Draft the approval warning language
	•	Propose a readonly “approved minutes” UI
	•	Suggest how to auto-inject motion/vote summaries into minutes
	•	Review motions/voting UI against Robert’s Rules next

Just say the word.
