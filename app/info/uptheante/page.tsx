      <h1>Up The Ante – Local Giving Made Simple</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Up The Ante</strong> is a charitable nonprofit that helps local
        communities keep their fundraising dollars close to home. We partner
        with neighborhood retailers to run
        <em>round‑up campaigns</em> at the point of sale — when a customer
        rounds their purchase up to the nearest dollar, the change adds up for
        good.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Retailers Collect Donations</strong> – Local businesses invite
          customers to round up at checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Up The Ante Manages the Funds</strong> – We receive the
          donations, retain <strong>5–7%</strong>
          to support our operations, and provide transparency and reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Charities Benefit Locally</strong> – The remaining funds are
          distributed back into the community, supporting school districts and
          other local 501(c)(3) organizations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is simple:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep donations local.</li>
        <li>
          Reduce the burden on business owners by streamlining fundraising
          requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Give communities a sustainable way to support schools and other causes
          that matter most.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By partnering with <strong>Up The Ante</strong>, businesses empower
        their customers to invest directly in the well‑being of their own
        neighborhoods — one small act of generosity at a time.
