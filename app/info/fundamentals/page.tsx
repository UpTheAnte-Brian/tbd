        <h2>1. Round-Up Fundraising Works</h2>
        <p>
          In 2024, Taco Bell’s Round Up campaign was named the top point-of-sale
          fundraiser in Engage For Good’s{" "}
          <em>America’s Charity Checkout Champions</em> report, raising more
          than <strong>$50 million</strong>—up 56% since 2022. An average
          donation of just $0.44 per customer helped power this impact across
          the U.S. [oai_citation:0‡Taco Bell

        <h2>2. Consumers Favor Retailers Supporting Local Communities</h2>
        <p>
          Retailers who demonstrate a genuine commitment to their local
          communities tend to build positive customer perceptions—people
          appreciate brands that “give back,” especially through accessible
          programs like round-up donations.

        <h2>3. It's Not That Hard for Retailers</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing a round-up program is relatively simple: just prompt
          customers to round up to the nearest dollar at checkout (whether
          in-store, drive-thru, or online). Small contributions, when aggregated
          across many transactions, can generate significant community impact—no
          complex infrastructure needed.
