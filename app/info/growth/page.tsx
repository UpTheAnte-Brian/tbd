        <h2>Why a For‑Profit Management Company?</h2>
        <p>
          Round‑up fundraising works, but school district foundations often lack
          the resources to manage ongoing programs. A dedicated for‑profit
          management company can ensure consistent execution and visibility,
          making the program sustainable and impactful.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The management company would partner with local retailers to set up
          year‑round round‑up donation campaigns. By taking a small percentage
          of the funds collected, the company is incentivized to maximize
          participation and fundraising results.

        <h2>Benefits for the Community</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Retailers are all set up and supported to collect donations.</li>
          <li>
            Awareness grows as more people in the district hear about the
            program.
          </li>
          <li>
            Foundations receive steady funding from at least one active retailer
            every day of the year.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Every school district foundation could count on having at least one
          retailer in their community collecting round‑up donations daily,
          creating a reliable stream of support for local students and schools.
